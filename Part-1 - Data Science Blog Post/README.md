### Introduction of the project

In this project, I did the analysis for Stack Overflow Survey Data 2019. This is a survey data which I took from their [website](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). This data contains nearly 90,000 responses from over 170 countries. I used jupyter notebook to do the analysis which you can find in the `Data Science Blog Post.ipynb` file.
<br>
<br>
For this analysis, I Mainly focused in answering these three most popular questions:
<br>

1. Is there any differences in terms of salary between people who contribute to open source and those who are not?
2. Which country has the highest job satisfaction for developers ?
3. Is there the difference in job satisfaction between developers whose undergraduate major is IT-related an those who are not ?

### Result Summary

After I did the analysis, these are the conclusion I found:

1. United States has the highest job satisfaction level for developers in the worldwide.
2. 5 of top 10 countries with the highest job satisfaction level are located in the Europe.
3. Developers whose undergraduate major is not IT-related have slightly better job satisfaction with good packages.
4. Developers who contribute more to the open source like free and famous open source project have the higher salary.

### Notes

Because the size of the data is large so I could not put the data in my github repository, but you can access or you can download the data from from share google-drive link which is public [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QOmVDpd8hcVYqqUXDXf68UMDWQZP0wQV/view). <br> <br>
After downloading the data,<br>
save the `survey_results_public.csv` file in the same directory with this notebook where you want to work on this project.
